L_Droid for the Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300

To build L-Droid you must first download the SlimKat source code (Please see www.slimroms.net for more info on this), then place this roomservice file in a folder called "local_manifests" in the ".repo" folder of your source code. Once set up, resync your sources to pull all the changes.

If you are building for another device, please substitute the appropriate device repos with your proper device repos.

Disclaimer: If you choose to build from my sources, you accept all risks that this involves and I am in no way liable for any damage or data loss that may occur in attempting to flash an Official or Un-Official L-Droid ROM.

Note: This source code may not work out of the box on other devices and may require extra work.
